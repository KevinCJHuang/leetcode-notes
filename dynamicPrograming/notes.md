## Dynamic Programing Notes
- DP can be used when a problem can be divided into similar sub-problems, and their results can be reused. The solution of the sub-problems are combined to get the final solution
- Steps:
  - Find a brute force solution
  - Look for repetitive steps/sub-problems in the bf solution.
  - Divide the problem into a sub-problem (i.e. how to get n from n-1, n-2, ...)
  - Solve the sub-problem
  - Iterate through the input and solve all sub-problems
  - return the solution to the last sub-problem
