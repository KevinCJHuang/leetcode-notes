# 875. Koko Eating Bananas https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/


# Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

# Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

# Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

# Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = max(piles)

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            count = sum([math.ceil(pile / mid) for pile in piles])

            if count > h:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        return left
